Hi Sara, A
Aim to be constantly consistent

Lunge Assessment v

film each leg 3-5 reps from a 45 degree angle

Active Straight Leg Raise v
Assessment

Film from a 45 degree angle
3-5 reps per side
Note any pain or tightness

MAP 9 v

30 minute AMRAP @ sustained pace
12 cal Airbike

12 cal Row

12 cal ski

We are working on pacing here so any time
the focus is AEROBIC I want you to think
about taking the time domain and multiplying
it by 4 meaning that you should be able to
hold the pace of this workout for 2 hours.

*If you do want to do this at home you can go
12 cal bike/12 cal row

if bike screen is broken -- go 3 min intervals
on each
